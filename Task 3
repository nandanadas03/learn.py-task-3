1 - Write a program which takes a number as input from the user and check whether the number is odd or even.If odd print the number is odd if not print it is even.

[ ]
#please enter your answer below this line
num=int(input ("enter any number"))
Flag=num
If Flag ==0;
    Print (num,"is an even number:")
elif Flag==1;
    Print (num,"is an odd number")
else:
    Print ("error, invalid input")
2 -Write a program to find the largest among three numbers and print the largest number.

[ ]
#please enter your answer below this line
n1=first number
n2=second number
n3=third number

n1=float (input ("enter first number:")
n2=float (input ("enter second number:")
n3=float (input ("enter third number:")

if(n1>=n2)and(n1>=n3):
largest=n1
elif(n2>=n1)and(n2>=n3):
largest=n2
else:
largest=n3
    Print ("the largest number is", largest)
3 -Write a function to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0.

If the score is out of range, print an error.
If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
Score Grade
         Score    Grade
        >= 0.9    A
        >= 0.8    B
        >= 0.7    C
        >= 0.6    D
         < 0.6    F
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.

[ ]
#please enter your answer below this li

s =  float(score)
x = 'Error'
if s >= 0.9:   
   x = 'A'
elif s >=0.8:    
     x='B'
elif s >=0.7: 
     x='C'
elif s >= 0.6: 
     x='D'
elif s < .6:  
     x ='F'
else:
 x ="Out of Range"
    print (x)
